# Hi, I’m Ethan 👋

I’m a high school student and aspiring engineer with a strong interest in **aerospace systems, embedded software, and the internet of vehicles**. I enjoy building low-level software that interfaces with hardware and thinking about how complex systems behave under real-world constraints.

My technical background started in software and security fundamentals, but through robotics and embedded projects I’ve grown increasingly interested in **safety-critical and performance-driven systems**, especially those found in aerospace and autonomous platforms.
